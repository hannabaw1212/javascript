<!-- HTML DOM Methods 
resources: https://www.w3schools.com/
HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
-->
<!--
    The DOM programming interface is the official W3C standard for interacting with HTML and XML documents.
    A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
    A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).
